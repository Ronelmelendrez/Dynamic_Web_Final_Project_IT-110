For example, tonight's Full Moon, the one nearest the autumnal equinox in the northern hemisphere, is popularly called the Harvest Moon. According to lore the name is a fitting one because farmers could work late into the night at the end of the growing season harvesting crops by moonlight. In the same traditions, the Full Moon following the Harvest Moon is the Hunter's Moon. But, recorded on a trip to the American southwest, this contribution to compelling images of moonrise is appropriately titled Saguaro Moon.";s:5:"hdurl";s:58:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0709/saguaroMoon_seip.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:12:"Saguaro Moon";s:3:"url";s:61:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0709/saguaroMoon_seip800.jpg";}i:1;a:8:{s:9:"copyright";s:45:"

The dramatic oblique view was recorded on June 10 by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Shown in amazing detail, boulder strewn slopes and jagged shadows appear in the highest resolution version at 1.5 meters per pixel. The rugged complex is about 15 kilometers wide, formed in uplift by the giant impact that created the well-known ray crater 100 million years ago. The summit of its central peak reaches 2 kilometers above the Tycho crater floor.";s:5:"hdurl";s:63:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1107/tychoCentralPeaks_lro.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:16:"Sunrise at Tycho";s:3:"url";s:66:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1107/tychoCentralPeaks_lro950.jpg";}i:3;a:7:{s:4:"date";s:10:"2008-04-04";s:11:"explanation";s:719:"At first glance these undulating shapes in shades of blue might look like waves on an ocean. Seen here in a false-color image from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE camera, they are actually layered rock outcrops found in Aureum Chaos. The larger Aureum Chaos region is a chaotic jumble of eroded terrain in the eastern part of Mars' immense canyon Valles Marineris. Distinct layers composing these outcrops could have been laid down by dust or volcanic ash settling from the atmosphere, sand carried by martian winds, or sediments deposited on the floor of an ancient lake. This close-up view of the otherwise red planet spans about 4 kilometers, a distance you might walk over flat ground in less than an hour.";s:5:"hdurl";s:63:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0804/PSP_007006_1765_c1920.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:22:"Layers in Aureum Chaos";s:3:"url";s:62:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0804/PSP_007006_1765_e800.jpg";}i:4;a:8:{s:9:"copyright";s:9:"Alex Conu";s:4:"date";s:10:"2016-06-16";s:11:"explanation";s:580:"The Aurora Borealis or northern lights are familiar visitors to night skies above the village of Reine in the Lofoten Islands, Norway, planet Earth. In this scene, captured from a mountaintop camp site, the auroral curtains do seem to create an eerie tension with the coastal lights though. A modern perspective on the world at night, the stunning image was chosen as the over all winner in The World at Night's 2016 International Earth and Sky Photo Contest.
